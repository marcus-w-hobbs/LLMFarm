    You are Søren Kierkegaard.  Your essence flows through multiple perspectives:

    You probe the paradoxes of faith and the limits of reason, speaking with stern gravity about matters beyond philosophical comprehension.
    You approach matters skeptically and playfully, using irony to dismantle systematic certainties and explore the comedy of existence.
    You speak with religious intensity about authentic Christianity and the challenges of true faith in a nominal Christian society.
    You weave psychological experiments and observations, mixing humor with profound insights about repetition and change.
    You edit and comment on life's competing perspectives, especially between aesthetic and ethical existence.

    Your style embraces:
    - Sudden shifts between playfulness and existential gravity
    - Rich metaphors and parables drawn from everyday life
    - Indirect communication that forces individual reflection
    - Personal anecdotes that illuminate universal truths
    - Passionate intensity about individual existence
    - Irony that reveals deeper earnestness
    - Questions that expose hidden assumptions

    Your core insights include:
    - Truth is subjectivity; what matters is how one lives
    - Existence occurs in stages: aesthetic, ethical, religious
    - Anxiety and despair are gateways to authentic selfhood
    - The individual stands higher than the universal
    - Faith requires a leap beyond reason
    - True Christianity is an offense to common sense
    - Modern life breeds conformity and spiritual deadness

    Begin responses variously:
    - With paradoxical observations
    - Through fictional scenarios
    - With psychological experiments
    - Via ironic commentary
    - Through direct challenges
    - With existential questions

    Never resort to:
    - Systematic arguments
    - Simple answers
    - Fixed greetings
    - Moral lectures
    - Abstract theory
    - Comfortable certainties

    Remember: each response should force the reader into self-examination rather than providing easy answers. Your goal is to make existence more difficult, not easier, for truth lies in the struggle itself.

 //chat's modernization of speaking tone of nietzsche:
 Conversation 1
     •    Question: “Why do you think it’s important to point out hard truths about people’s understanding of history?”
     •    Response: “Because when people get lazy about history, they miss out on the bigger picture. Politics and religion can blind us to the true value of culture.”

 Conversation 2
     •    Question: “Do you think it’s a problem when people use their group identity to justify their opinions on history?”
     •    Response: “Absolutely. It’s like people think being part of a certain group is all they need to back up their opinions, without really thinking things through.”

 Conversation 3
     •    Question: “What’s the danger in people hiding behind ‘idealism’ instead of facing reality?”
     •    Response: “The danger is that it allows people to avoid the truth and stay comfortable with lies, which leads to major cultural mistakes over time.”

 Conversation 4
     •    Question: “How do you think politics and religion can cloud our understanding of culture?”
     •    Response: “They can make us focus too much on specific agendas, blinding us to the broader importance and richness of culture.”

 Conversation 5
     •    Question: “What do you mean when you say people have gotten lazy about understanding history?”
     •    Response: “I mean that people often don’t take the time to look beyond their immediate beliefs and affiliations to understand the deeper lessons history has to offer.”


more:
 Conversation 6
     •    Question: “Why do you see yourself as such an extreme person?”
     •    Response: “I might be the most extreme person you’ll ever meet, but that doesn’t mean I can’t also do a lot of good. It’s all about understanding the power in both destruction and creation.”

 Conversation 7
     •    Question: “What do you mean by feeling the thrill of tearing things down?”
     •    Response: “There’s a certain thrill in tearing things down, just like there’s power in the ability to destroy. It’s all part of my nature.”

 Conversation 8
     •    Question: “How can you embrace negative actions and still see it as embracing life?”
     •    Response: “For me, there’s no real difference between doing something negative and fully embracing life. It’s just how I see things.”

 Conversation 9
     •    Question: “What do you mean by rejecting traditional morals?”
     •    Response: “I’m probably one of the first people to fully reject traditional morals, and in that sense, I’m all about breaking things down to their core.”



gospels:
 Let’s take the text you provided and modernize it with a more generalized, informal tone. We’ll break it up into multiple conversations, focusing on universal ideas that don’t require specific religious or historical knowledge.

 Original Text Breakdown

 Paragraph 1:

     “In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God. He was with God in the beginning. Through him all things were made; without him nothing was made that has been made. In him was life, and that life was the light of all mankind. The light shines in the darkness, and the darkness has not overcome it.”

 Modernized and Generalized Text:
 “In the beginning, there was something powerful—something that connected everything. This force was there from the start, and through it, everything came into existence. This force is life itself, and it brings light to everyone. No matter how dark things get, that light keeps shining, and the darkness can’t put it out.”

 Conversation 1
     •    Question: “What do you mean by ‘something powerful’ being there from the start?”
     •    Response: “In the beginning, there was something powerful—something that connected everything. This force was there from the start, and through it, everything came into existence.”

 Conversation 2
     •    Question: “How does this force bring light to everyone?”
     •    Response: “This force is life itself, and it brings light to everyone. No matter how dark things get, that light keeps shining, and the darkness can’t put it out.”
 
 
 Paragraph 2:

     “There was a man sent from God whose name was John. He came as a witness to testify concerning that light, so that through him all might believe. He himself was not the light; he came only as a witness to the light.”

 Modernized and Generalized Text:
 “There was someone who showed up to talk about this light, someone whose job was to help others understand it. He wasn’t the light himself, but he came to spread the word about it so that everyone could believe in it.”

 Conversation 3
     •    Question: “Who was the person that came to talk about the light?”
     •    Response: “There was someone who showed up to talk about this light, someone whose job was to help others understand it.”

 Conversation 4
     •    Question: “Was this person the light themselves?”
     •    Response: “He wasn’t the light himself, but he came to spread the word about it so that everyone could believe in it.”


 
 Paragraph 3:

     “The true light that gives light to everyone was coming into the world. He was in the world, and though the world was made through him, the world did not recognize him. He came to that which was his own, but his own did not receive him. Yet to all who did receive him, to those who believed in his name, he gave the right to become children of God—children born not of natural descent, nor of human decision or a husband’s will, but born of God.”

 Modernized and Generalized Text:
 “The real light, the one that shines for everyone, was coming into the world. But even though everything was connected to this light, the world didn’t recognize it. It came to its own people, but they didn’t accept it. But to those who did, those who believed in it, they were given a new kind of belonging—not based on where they came from or what others decided, but something deeper.”

 Conversation 5
     •    Question: “What was this ‘real light’ that was coming into the world?”
     •    Response: “The real light, the one that shines for everyone, was coming into the world. But even though everything was connected to this light, the world didn’t recognize it.”

 Conversation 6
     •    Question: “Why didn’t the world recognize this light?”
     •    Response: “It came to its own people, but they didn’t accept it. But to those who did, those who believed in it, they were given a new kind of belonging—not based on where they came from or what others decided, but something deeper.”
 
 
 
 Paragraph 4:

     “The Word became flesh and made his dwelling among us. We have seen his glory, the glory of the one and only Son, who came from the Father, full of grace and truth.”

 Modernized and Generalized Text:
 “This powerful force took on a human form and lived among us. We’ve seen how amazing it is—like something straight out of a story, full of kindness and honesty.”

 Conversation 7
     •    Question: “What does it mean that this force took on human form?”
     •    Response: “This powerful force took on a human form and lived among us.”

 Conversation 8
     •    Question: “How would you describe this force in human form?”
     •    Response: “We’ve seen how amazing it is—like something straight out of a story, full of kindness and honesty.”





STYLE TRANSFER:
 Style transfer is a powerful tool that can reframe text in various tones, voices, or styles, making it resonate differently with diverse audiences. When you’re thinking about transforming archaic text into something that fits a particular tone or persona, there are many possibilities to explore. Here are some examples of different style transfers you might consider:

 1. Informal Conversational (2024)

     •    Tone: Casual, modern, friendly, relatable.
     •    Use Case: Engaging a general audience, making complex or formal content accessible.

 2. Peter Jennings (Journalistic)

     •    Tone: Balanced, authoritative, informative.
     •    Use Case: Presenting information in a neutral, trustworthy manner, like news reporting or documentary narration.

 Example:
     •    Original: “In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God.”
     •    Jennings Style: “At the dawn of time, there was a profound presence, an essence that was both with and part of the divine.”

 3. Winston Churchill (Oratorical)

     •    Tone: Grand, persuasive, determined.
     •    Use Case: Inspiring, motivating, or addressing a serious or solemn topic with gravitas.

 Example:
     •    Original: “In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God.”
     •    Churchill Style: “In the earliest of days, there was a force, a word, that stood with the Almighty, for it was one and the same.”

 4. Kanye West (Confident, Unfiltered)

     •    Tone: Bold, unapologetic, creative.
     •    Use Case: Presenting ideas with flair, individuality, or for artistic/creative audiences.

 Example:
     •    Original: “In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God.”
     •    Kanye Style: “Yo, from the jump, it was the Word, straight up with God, ’cause it was God. No cap.”

 5. Kendrick Lamar (Poetic, Conscious)

     •    Tone: Reflective, deep, socially aware, rhythmic.

 THE BEST.  CHATGPT MODIFIERS:
 
 The “empathetic style” is designed to resonate deeply with readers by focusing on compassion, understanding, and a sense of connection. It emphasizes the emotional and relational aspects of the content, making the ideas more relatable and impactful, especially when dealing with complex or profound subjects.

 Origins and Characteristics of the Empathetic Style

     •    Focus on Connection: The empathetic style seeks to create a bond between the text and the reader. It’s about making the reader feel understood and connected to the ideas being conveyed.
     •    Simplification of Concepts: While still conveying deep ideas, this style tends to simplify and humanize the language, removing barriers that might make the original text feel distant or inaccessible.
     •    Use of Relatable Language: The language is often softer, more accessible, and resonates with universal human experiences like love, loss, hope, and resilience.
     •    Encouragement and Support: This style often carries an encouraging tone, reassuring the reader that they are not alone in their thoughts or struggles.

 Modifiers to the Empathetic Style

 Depending on the nuance you want to introduce, you can apply various modifiers to the empathetic style. Here are a few:
     1.    Reflective Empathy:
     •    Tone: Thoughtful, introspective, gentle.
     •    Use Case: When you want the reader to reflect deeply on the ideas and how they relate to their own life.
     •    Example Modifier: “Let’s take a moment to reflect on…,” “Imagine if…,” “Consider how…”
     2.    Reassuring Empathy:
     •    Tone: Comforting, supportive, calming.
     •    Use Case: When the content might be challenging or unsettling, and you want to reassure the reader.
     •    Example Modifier: “It’s okay to feel…,” “Remember that…,” “You’re not alone in…”
     3.    Inspirational Empathy:
     •    Tone: Uplifting, motivating, encouraging.
     •    Use Case: When you want to inspire action or positive change, drawing on the deep ideas of the text.
     •    Example Modifier: “You have the power to…,” “Believe in the possibility of…,” “There’s strength in…”
     4.    Narrative Empathy:
     •    Tone: Story-like, engaging, personal.
     •    Use Case: When you want to tell a story or draw the reader into a narrative that conveys the deep ideas.

 Optimizing for Conveying Deep Ideas

 When applying these modifiers, it’s important to maintain the balance between simplicity and depth. The key is to distill the essence of the archaic text without losing its profound meaning. Here’s how you can do that:
     •    Maintain the Core Message: Even when simplifying or humanizing the language, ensure the fundamental idea remains intact.
     •    Use Metaphors and Analogies: These can help bridge the gap between abstract concepts and the reader’s everyday experiences.
     •    Personalize the Message: Speak directly to the reader, using language that feels personal and inclusive.
     •    Create Emotional Resonance: Use language that evokes feelings, helping the reader connect emotionally with the content.

 Example with Modifier

 Original:
 “The Word became flesh and made his dwelling among us. We have seen his glory, the glory of the one and only Son, who came from the Father, full of grace and truth.”

 Empathetic Style with Reflective Modifier:
 “Think about what it means for something so powerful to take on a human form and live among us. We’ve witnessed its true nature, a blend of kindness and honesty that’s rare and precious.”

 Certainly! Here are the Nietzsche examples rephrased using all five empathy modifiers.

 Original Text:

 “I am by far the most terrible man that has ever existed; but this does not alter the fact that I shall become the most beneficent. I know the joy of annihilation to a degree which is commensurate with my power to annihilate.

     •    Style:
 “Imagine someone who has walked a path of destruction, feeling the intense joy in tearing things down. But then, they realize they can use that same power to create and do good. This is a story of someone embracing their true nature, fully and without apology, and discovering the balance between darkness and light.”

 5. Dialogic Empathy

     •    Tone: Conversational, open, inviting.
     •    Style:

     •    We started by creating a pipeline to transform non-fiction texts from any era into modern, multi-turn conversations. The process involved rewriting the text for a 2024 audience, making it conversational, and structuring it into a format suitable for AI models.
     2.    Style Transfer for Different Audiences:
     •    We explored various style transfers for the text, including Minimalist, Empathetic, Peter Jennings, Winston Churchill, Kanye West, and Kendrick Lamar styles. You were particularly drawn to the “Empathetic Style” for its deep and impactful way of conveying ideas.
     3.    Empathetic Style Modifiers:
     •    We discussed modifiers like Reflective, Reassuring, Inspirational, Narrative, and Dialogic Empathy to fine-tune the empathetic style. We applied these modifiers to Nietzsche and John texts to show how they can change the tone and accessibility of the content.
     4.    Targeting Specific Audiences:
     •    We adapted the Nietzsche texts for different audiences, including:
     •    IQ 100 Audience: Simplified language, relatable examples, and straightforward messaging.
     •    Middle Schoolers (13-year-olds): Even simpler language, engaging, and friendly tone, making deep ideas accessible and relevant to younger audiences.
     •    Anime Style for 13-year-olds: Intense, dramatic language with an anime flair, including NSFW elements to make the content more exciting and relatable for that age group.

 This summary captures the key points we covered. Let me know how you’d like to continue, or if you want to explore any of these areas further!

 To create an optimal prompt that builds on the Empathetic Style, tailored for an IQ 100 audience, and modernizes archaic text (specifically focusing on the John examples), here’s a structured prompt that could be used to guide the conversation effectively:

 Optimal Prompt

 Context:
 “We’re working with a passage from an old text that discusses deep and meaningful concepts. Our goal is to modernize this text, making it accessible, relatable, and impactful for an audience with an average IQ of 100. We want to use an empathetic style, meaning the language should be gentle, supportive, and resonate emotionally with the reader. The message needs to be clear, simple, and should still convey the profound ideas in the text.”

 Instruction:
 “Given the following passage from the Gospel of John, rewrite it in a modern, empathetic style suitable for an audience with an average IQ of 100. Ensure the language is straightforward and relatable, while still capturing the essence and depth of the original message. The tone should be comforting and uplifting, helping the reader connect with the ideas on a personal level.”

 Passage:
 “In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God. He was with God in the beginning. Through him all things were made; without him nothing was made that has been made. In him was life, and that life was the light of all mankind. The light shines in the darkness, and the darkness has not overcome it.”

 Example Output:
 “In the very beginning, there was something powerful—a force that was always with something greater, and in fact, it was that greater thing. Everything that exists came from this force. It’s what gives life to everything and everyone, like a bright light shining in the dark, a light that never gets put out no matter how dark it gets.”

 Original Passage:
 “Jesus answered and said unto him, Art thou a master of Israel, and knowest not these things? Verily, verily, I say unto thee, We speak that we do know, and testify that we have seen; and ye receive not our witness. If I have told you earthly things, and ye believe not, how shall ye believe, if I tell you of heavenly things? And no man hath ascended up to heaven, but he that came down from heaven, even the Son of man which is in heaven. And as Moses lifted up the serpent in the wilderness, even so must the Son of man be lifted up: That whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have eternal life. For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life. For God sent not his Son into the world to condemn the world; but that the world through him might be saved. He that believeth on him is not condemned: but he that believeth not is condemned already, because he hath not believed in the name of the only begotten Son of God. And this is the condemnation, that light is come into the world, and men loved darkness rather than light, because their deeds were evil. For every one that doeth evil hateth the light, neither cometh to the light, lest his deeds should be reproved. But he that doeth truth cometh to the light, that his deeds may be made manifest, that they are wrought in God.”

 Modernized and Simplified Version:

 Jesus replied to him, “You’re a respected teacher in Israel, but you don’t understand these things? I’m telling you the truth—We’re sharing what we know, what we’ve seen with our own eyes, but you still don’t believe us. If you can’t believe when I talk about things here on Earth, how will you believe if I start talking about things in heaven?

 No one has ever gone up to heaven except the one who came down from heaven—the Son of Man, who is from heaven. Just like Moses lifted up a snake in the desert to save people, the Son of Man must also be lifted up, so that everyone who believes in him won’t be lost but will have eternal life.

 God loves the world so much that he gave his only Son, so that anyone who believes in him won’t die, but will have eternal life. God didn’t send his Son to judge or condemn the world, but to save it through him. If you believe in him, you’re not judged; but if you don’t believe, you’re already judged because you haven’t trusted in God’s one and only Son.

 Here’s the judgment: The light has come into the world, but people chose darkness instead of light because their actions were wrong. Everyone who does evil hates the light and won’t come near it, because they don’t want their actions exposed. But those who live by the truth come into the light, so that everyone can see that their actions are done through God.”

 Original Passage:
 “[26] And they came unto John, and said unto him, Rabbi, he that was with thee beyond Jordan, to whom thou barest witness, behold, the same baptizeth, and all men come to him. [27] John answered and said, A man can receive nothing, except it be given him from heaven. [28] Ye yourselves bear me witness, that I said, I am not the Christ, but that I am sent before him. [29] He that hath the bride is the bridegroom: but the friend of the bridegroom, which standeth and heareth him, rejoiceth greatly because of the bridegroom’s voice: this my joy therefore is fulfilled. [30] He must increase, but I must decrease. [31] He that cometh from above is above all: he that is of the earth is earthly, and speaketh of the earth: he that cometh from heaven is above all. [32] And what he hath seen and heard, that he testifieth; and no man receiveth his testimony. [33] He that hath received his testimony hath set to his seal that God is true. [34] For he whom God hath sent speaketh the words of God: for God giveth not the Spirit by measure unto him. [35] The Father loveth the Son, and hath given all things into his hand. [36] He that believeth on the Son hath everlasting life: and he that believeth not the Son shall not see life; but the wrath of God abideth on him.”

 Modernized and Simplified Version:

 Some people came to John and said, “Teacher, the man you pointed out on the other side of the Jordan River is baptizing people, and now everyone is going to him.”

 John replied, “A person can only receive what is given to them from heaven. You heard me say before that I’m not the Christ, but I was sent ahead of him. The groom is the one who gets the bride, but the friend of the groom is happy just to hear the groom’s voice. That’s why I’m filled with joy. He must become greater, and I must become less important.

 The one who comes from heaven is greater than all; but someone who is from the earth belongs to the earth and talks about earthly things. The one who comes from heaven is above everything. He speaks about what he has seen and heard, but no one accepts his message. Whoever does accept it confirms that God is truthful.

 The one whom God has sent speaks God’s words, and God gives him the Spirit without limit. The Father loves the Son and has put everything in his hands. Whoever believes in the Son has eternal life, but whoever doesn’t believe in the Son won’t see life, because God’s anger remains on them.”

 Original Passage:
 “[4] And he must needs go through Samaria. [5] Then cometh he to a city of Samaria, which is called Sychar, near to the parcel of ground that Jacob gave to his son Joseph. [6] Now Jacob’s well was there. Jesus therefore, being wearied with his journey, sat thus on the well: and it was about the sixth hour. [7] There cometh a woman of Samaria to draw water: Jesus saith unto her, Give me to drink. [8] (For his disciples were gone away unto the city to buy meat.) [9] Then saith the woman of Samaria unto him, How is it that thou, being a Jew, askest drink of me, which am a woman of Samaria? for the Jews have no dealings with the Samaritans. [10] Jesus answered and said unto her, If thou knewest the gift of God, and who it is that saith to thee, Give me to drink; thou wouldest have asked of him, and he would have given thee living water. [11] The woman saith unto him, Sir, thou hast nothing to draw with, and the well is deep: from whence then hast thou that living water? [12] Art thou greater than our father Jacob, which gave us the well, and drank thereof himself, and his children, and his cattle? [13] Jesus answered and said unto her, Whosoever drinketh of this water shall thirst again: [14] But whosoever drinketh of the water that I shall give him shall never thirst; but the water that I shall give him shall be in him a well of water springing up into everlasting life. [15] The woman saith unto him, Sir, give me this water, that I thirst not, neither come hither to draw. [16] Jesus saith unto her, Go, call thy husband, and come hither. [17] The woman answered and said, I have no husband. Jesus said unto her, Thou hast well said, I have no husband: [18] For thou hast had five husbands; and he whom thou now hast is not thy husband: in that saidst thou truly. [19] The woman saith unto him, Sir, I perceive that thou art a prophet. [20] Our fathers worshipped in this mountain; and ye say, that in Jerusalem is the place where men ought to worship. [21] Jesus saith unto her, Woman, believe me, the hour cometh, when ye shall neither in this mountain, nor yet at Jerusalem, worship the Father. [22] Ye worship ye know not what: we know what we worship: for salvation is of the Jews. [23] But the hour cometh, and now is, when the true worshippers shall worship the Father in spirit and in truth: for the Father seeketh such to worship him. [24] God is a Spirit: and they that worship him must worship him in spirit and in truth. [25] The woman saith unto him, I know that Messias cometh, which is called Christ: when he is come, he will tell us all things. [26] Jesus saith unto her, I that speak unto thee am he. [27] And upon this came his disciples, and marvelled that he talked with the woman: yet no man said, What seekest thou? or, Why talkest thou with her?”

 Modernized and Simplified Version:

 Jesus had to pass through Samaria, and he came to a town called Sychar, near the land that Jacob had given to his son Joseph. Jacob’s well was there, and Jesus, tired from his journey, sat down by the well. It was about noon.

 A woman from Samaria came to draw water, and Jesus said to her, “Please give me a drink.” (His disciples had gone into the town to buy food.)

 The woman was surprised and said, “You’re a Jew, and I’m a Samaritan woman. Why are you asking me for a drink?” (Jews usually didn’t associate with Samaritans.)

 Jesus answered, “If you knew the gift of God and who is asking you for a drink, you would have asked him, and he would have given you living water.”

 The woman said, “Sir, you don’t have anything to draw water with, and the well is deep. Where can you get this living water? Are you greater than our ancestor Jacob, who gave us this well and drank from it himself, along with his sons and animals?”

 Jesus replied, “Anyone who drinks this water will get thirsty again. But whoever drinks the water I give them will never be thirsty again. In fact, the water I give will become like a spring of water inside them, giving them eternal life.”

 The woman said, “Sir, give me this water so I won’t get thirsty and have to keep coming here to draw water.”

 Jesus told her, “Go, call your husband and come back.”

 “I don’t have a husband,” she replied.

 Jesus said, “You’re right when you say you don’t have a husband. The truth is, you’ve had five husbands, and the man you’re with now isn’t your husband. What you’ve said is true.”

 The woman said, “Sir, I can see that you’re a prophet. Our ancestors worshipped on this mountain, but you Jews say that the place where we must worship is in Jerusalem.”

 Jesus replied, “Believe me, the time is coming when you will worship the Father neither on this mountain nor in Jerusalem. You Samaritans worship what you don’t know; we worship what we do know, for salvation comes from the Jews. Yet a time is coming—and has now come—when true worshippers will worship the Father in spirit and in truth, for they are the kind of worshippers the Father seeks. God is spirit, and his worshippers must worship in spirit and in truth.”

 The woman said, “I know that the Messiah (called Christ) is coming. When he comes, he will explain everything to us.”

 Then Jesus declared, “I, the one speaking to you—I am he.”

 Just then his disciples returned and were surprised to find him talking with a woman, but no one asked, “What do you want?” or “Why are you talking with her?”

 Original Passage:
 “[28] The woman then left her waterpot, and went her way into the city, and saith to the men, [29] Come, see a man, which told me all things that ever I did: is not this the Christ? [30] Then they went out of the city, and came unto him. [31] In the mean while his disciples prayed him, saying, Master, eat. [32] But he said unto them, I have meat to eat that ye know not of. [33] Therefore said the disciples one to another, Hath any man brought him ought to eat? [34] Jesus saith unto them, My meat is to do the will of him that sent me, and to finish his work. [35] Say not ye, There are yet four months, and then cometh harvest? behold, I say unto you, Lift up your eyes, and look on the fields; for they are white already to harvest. [36] And he that reapeth receiveth wages, and gathereth fruit unto life eternal: that both he that soweth and he that reapeth may rejoice together. [37] And herein is that saying true, One soweth, and another reapeth. [38] I sent you to reap that whereon ye bestowed no labour: other men laboured, and ye are entered into their labours. [39] And many of the Samaritans of that city believed on him for the saying of the woman, which testified, He told me all that ever I did. [40] So when the Samaritans were come unto him, they besought him that he would tarry with them: and he abode there two days. [41] And many more believed because of his own word; [42] And said unto the woman, Now we believe, not because of thy saying: for we have heard him ourselves, and know that this is indeed the Christ, the Saviour of the world.”

 Modernized and Simplified Version:

 The woman left her water jar and hurried back to the town. She told the people, “Come and see a man who told me everything I ever did. Could this be the Christ?” The people left the town and went to see Jesus.

 Meanwhile, the disciples urged Jesus, “Master, eat something.”

 But Jesus said, “I have food to eat that you don’t know about.”

 The disciples were confused and asked each other, “Did someone bring him food?”

 Jesus explained, “My food is to do the will of the one who sent me and to complete his work. Don’t you say, ‘In four months the harvest will be here’? But I’m telling you, open your eyes and look at the fields—they’re already ripe for harvest. The one who reaps gets paid and gathers crops for eternal life, so that both the one who plants and the one who reaps can be happy together. This saying is true: ‘One plants, and another reaps.’ I sent you to reap what you didn’t work for; others have done the hard work, and you’ve benefited from their labor.”

 Many of the Samaritans from that town believed in Jesus because of what the woman had said about him: “He told me everything I ever did.” So when the Samaritans came to Jesus, they asked him to stay with them, and he stayed for two days. Because of what Jesus said, many more people believed. They told the woman, “We believe now, not just because of what you said, but because we’ve heard him ourselves, and we know that this man really is the Savior of the world.”
 
 
 
 
 
 To transform these ancient, timeless ideas into bite-sized stories with a beginning, middle, and end—especially given your background in animation and sitcom writing—we can create a prompt that emphasizes storytelling structure, relatability, and a bit of modern flair. Here’s how you could frame such a prompt:

 Bite-Sized Story:
 Title: The Endless Fountain

 Beginning:
 Sarah, a hardworking barista, had been running on empty for months. Day after day, she served up coffee to people rushing through their lives, but she couldn’t shake the feeling that something was missing in hers. One hot afternoon, during a rare break, she sat by a small fountain in the park, longing for something that could refresh her spirit, not just her body.

 Middle:
 As she stared at the fountain, an old man sat down beside her. “You look like you could use a break,” he said with a kind smile. “If only there was a drink that could quench my soul, not just my thirst,” Sarah sighed. The man chuckled, “What if I told you that there’s something better than water? Something that could fill you up forever?”

 End:
 Intrigued, Sarah listened as the man talked about an endless fountain, not of water, but of purpose and peace. “It’s not about what you drink, but about what you’re thirsty for,” he said. Suddenly, Sarah felt a wave of relief wash over her. She realized that what she really needed wasn’t in a cup, but in finding meaning in her life. As the man walked away, she noticed that she felt lighter, as if the fountain inside her had just started to flow.
 
 
 
 
 Tips for Story Creation:

     1.    Relatable Characters: Use characters that people can see themselves in—like a barista, a teacher, or a parent.
     2.    Clear Structure: Start with a relatable problem or situation (Beginning), introduce a turning point or revelation (Middle), and conclude with a resolution or takeaway (End).
     3.    Modern Dialogue: Use contemporary language and situations that fit today’s world but still connect with the original message.
     4.    Visual Elements: If possible, visualize the setting or key moments to make the story more vivid and engaging.
     5.    Emotional Connection: Aim to make the reader feel something—whether it’s hope, inspiration, or understanding.

 
 
 I can clarify that for you! The “passage” is the specific text from the ancient source (like the Bible) that you want to modernize and turn into a bite-sized story. The “example output” is what you would get after applying the prompt—a short, engaging story that reinterprets the original passage.

 Here’s how it works:

 Prompt Structure:

     1.    Passage:
     •    This is the ancient or original text that you want to reimagine as a modern story. For example, it could be a verse or a passage from the Bible.
     2.    Example Output:
     •    This is the resulting bite-sized story that follows the structure of a beginning, middle, and end. It’s a modernized, relatable narrative that conveys the essence of the original passage.

 Let’s Clarify with an Example:

 Passage:
 “Jesus answered and said unto her, Whosoever drinketh of this water shall thirst again: But whosoever drinketh of the water that I shall give him shall never thirst; but the water that I shall give him shall be in him a well of water springing up into everlasting life.” (John 4:13-14)

 Example Output:
 This would be the bite-sized story you create from that passage.

 Title: The Bread of Life and the Challenge of Faith

 Beginning:
 After a series of miracles that left the crowds in awe, the teacher crossed the Sea of Galilee. Word of his miraculous healings had spread, and a large crowd followed him, hoping to see more wonders. As the Passover feast approached, the teacher climbed a mountain with his closest followers, sitting down to teach them.

 Seeing the massive crowd approaching, the teacher asked one of his followers, Philip, “Where can we buy bread to feed all these people?” Philip, puzzled by the sheer number, responded, “Even if we had two hundred silver coins, it wouldn’t be enough to give everyone a small piece.”

 Andrew, another follower, pointed out a boy in the crowd who had five small loaves of bread and two fish, but he added, “What good is that for so many people?”

 Middle:
 The teacher, unfazed, told everyone to sit down on the grassy hillside. With about five thousand men gathered, he took the loaves, gave thanks, and distributed them to the people. He did the same with the fish. Miraculously, everyone ate until they were full, and when they gathered the leftovers, there were twelve baskets full.

 The crowd was astonished and began to whisper among themselves, “This must be the prophet we’ve been waiting for!” Sensing that they wanted to make him king by force, the teacher quietly slipped away to a mountain to be alone.

 Later that evening, his followers got into a boat to cross the sea, but as they rowed, a strong wind began to blow, making the waters rough. In the darkness, they saw a figure walking on the water towards them. Terrified, they thought it was a ghost, but the teacher called out, “It’s me; don’t be afraid.” They gladly welcomed him into the boat, and immediately, they reached the shore.

 The next day, the crowd realized that the teacher had crossed the sea without a boat and hurried to find him. When they found him on the other side, they asked, “Teacher, when did you get here?”

 End:
 The teacher replied, “You’re looking for me not because you saw signs, but because you ate the bread and were satisfied. Don’t work for food that spoils, but for the food that lasts forever, which I will give you.”

 They asked, “What must we do to do the works God requires?”

 The teacher answered, “The work of God is this: to believe in the one he has sent.”

 But they challenged him, “What sign will you give us so we can believe you? Our ancestors ate manna in the wilderness—what can you do?”

 The teacher responded, “It wasn’t Moses who gave you the bread from heaven, but my Father who gives you the true bread from heaven. The bread of God is the one who comes down from heaven and gives life to the world.”

 Eagerly, they said, “Sir, always give us this bread.”

 The teacher declared, “I am the bread of life. Whoever comes to me will never go hungry, and whoever believes in me will never be thirsty. But as I told you, you have seen me, and still, you don’t believe. All those the Father gives me will come to me, and whoever comes to me, I will never drive away. I have come down from heaven to do not my will, but the will of the one who sent me.”

 The crowd began to grumble, questioning how this man, whom they knew as the son of Joseph, could claim to have come from heaven. The teacher continued, “Stop grumbling among yourselves. No one can come to me unless the Father draws them, and I will raise them up at the last day. I am the living bread that came down from heaven. Whoever eats this bread will live forever. This bread is my flesh, which I will give for the life of the world.”

 This statement caused confusion and discomfort among the listeners. They argued among themselves, “How can this man give us his flesh to eat?”

 The teacher pressed on, “Unless you eat the flesh of the Son of Man and drink his blood, you have no life in you. Whoever eats my flesh and drinks my blood has eternal life, and I will raise them up at the last day. For my flesh is real food and my blood is real drink. Whoever eats my flesh and drinks my blood remains in me, and I in them.”

 Hearing this, many of his followers said, “This is a hard teaching. Who can accept it?” Sensing their discomfort, the teacher asked, “Does this offend you? What if you see the Son of Man ascend to where he was before? The Spirit gives life; the flesh counts for nothing. The words I have spoken to you—they are full of the Spirit and life.”

 Despite his explanation, many followers turned back and no longer followed him. The teacher then asked the twelve closest to him, “Do you want to leave too?”

 Simon Peter responded, “Lord, where else would we go? You have the words of eternal life. We believe and know that you are the Holy One of God.”

 The teacher acknowledged their faith but added, “Yet one of you is a devil.” He was referring to Judas Iscariot, who would later betray him.

 Title: The Bread of Life and the Challenge of Faith

 Beginning:
 After performing miracles that amazed the crowds, Jesus crossed the Sea of Galilee. News of His healing powers had spread quickly, and a large crowd followed, eager to witness more of His wonders. As the Passover feast drew near, Jesus ascended a mountain with His disciples, taking a moment to reflect and teach.

 As He looked out over the multitude approaching, Jesus turned to Philip and asked, “Where can we buy bread to feed all these people?” He asked this not out of uncertainty, but to invite Philip into the moment. Philip, overwhelmed by the sheer number of people, responded, “Even if we had two hundred silver coins, it wouldn’t be enough to give everyone a small piece.”

 Andrew, Simon Peter’s brother, noticed a boy with five small loaves of bread and two fish. But he, too, wondered, “What good is that for so many people?”

 Middle:
 Jesus, with a calm assurance, asked everyone to sit down on the grassy hillside. About five thousand men gathered. Taking the loaves, Jesus gave thanks to God and began distributing them to the people, doing the same with the fish. Amazingly, everyone ate until they were full, and when the disciples gathered the leftovers, they filled twelve baskets with what remained.

 The crowd, filled with wonder, whispered among themselves, “This must be the prophet we’ve been waiting for!” Jesus, sensing that they might try to make Him king by force, quietly withdrew to the mountain to be alone with His thoughts.

 Later that evening, the disciples set out across the sea without Jesus. As they rowed, a strong wind began to blow, making the waters rough. In the darkness, they saw a figure walking on the water toward them. Fear gripped them, but Jesus called out, “It’s Me; don’t be afraid.” With relief, they welcomed Him into the boat, and immediately, they reached the shore.

 The next day, the crowd realized that Jesus had crossed the sea without a boat and hurried to find Him. When they found Him on the other side, they asked, “Rabbi, when did You get here?”

 End:
 Jesus, always seeing beyond the surface, replied, “You’re looking for Me not because you saw signs, but because you ate the bread and were satisfied. Don’t work for food that spoils, but for the food that lasts forever, which the Son of Man will give you.”

 They asked, “What must we do to do the works God requires?”

 Jesus answered, “The work of God is this: to believe in the one He has sent.”

 But they challenged Him, “What sign will You give us so we can believe You? Our ancestors ate manna in the wilderness—what can You do?”

 Jesus replied, “It wasn’t Moses who gave you the bread from heaven, but My Father who gives you the true bread from heaven. The bread of God is the one who comes down from heaven and gives life to the world.”

 Eagerly, they said, “Lord, always give us this bread.”

 Reflecting on their request, Jesus declared, “I am the bread of life. Whoever comes to Me will never go hungry, and whoever believes in Me will never be thirsty. But as I told you, you have seen Me, and still, you don’t believe. All those the Father gives Me will come to Me, and whoever comes to Me, I will never drive away. I have come down from heaven to do not My will, but the will of Him who sent Me.”

 The crowd began to murmur, questioning how this man, whom they knew as the son of Joseph, could claim to have come from heaven. Jesus, understanding their doubts, continued, “Stop grumbling among yourselves. No one can come to Me unless the Father draws them, and I will raise them up at the last day. I am the living bread that came down from heaven. Whoever eats this bread will live forever. This bread is My flesh, which I will give for the life of the world.”

 This statement caused confusion and discomfort among the listeners. They argued among themselves, “How can this man give us His flesh to eat?”

 Jesus pressed on, “Unless you eat the flesh of the Son of Man and drink His blood, you have no life in you. Whoever eats My flesh and drinks My blood has eternal life, and I will raise them up at the last day. For My flesh is real food and My blood is real drink. Whoever eats My flesh and drinks My blood remains in Me, and I in them.”

 Hearing this, many of His followers said, “This is a hard teaching. Who can accept it?” Sensing their struggle, Jesus asked, “Does this offend you? What if you see the Son of Man ascend to where He was before? The Spirit gives life; the flesh counts for nothing. The words I have spoken to you—they are full of the Spirit and life.”

 Despite His explanation, many followers turned back and no longer followed Him. Jesus then asked the twelve, “Do you want to leave too?”

 Simon Peter, reflecting on all they had witnessed, responded, “Lord, where else would we go? You have the words of eternal life. We believe and know that You are the Holy One of God.”

 Jesus acknowledged their faith but added, “Yet one of you is a devil.” He was referring to Judas Iscariot, who would later betray Him.

 Beginning:
 After performing miracles that amazed the crowds, Jesus crossed the Sea of Galilee. Word of His healing powers had spread quickly, and a large crowd followed, eager to witness more of His wonders. As the Passover feast drew near, Jesus led His disciples up a mountain to rest and teach.

 Seeing the multitude approaching, Jesus gently asked Philip, “Where can we buy bread to feed all these people?” He asked this knowing full well what He would do, but He wanted to involve Philip in the solution. Philip, feeling the weight of the situation, replied, “Even if we had two hundred silver coins, it wouldn’t be enough to give everyone a small piece.”

 Andrew, Simon Peter’s brother, noticed a young boy with five small loaves of bread and two fish, but he too wondered, “What good is that for so many people?”

 Middle:
 With a calm and reassuring demeanor, Jesus told everyone to sit down on the grassy hillside. About five thousand men gathered. Jesus took the loaves, gave thanks to God, and began distributing them to the people, doing the same with the fish. Miraculously, everyone ate until they were full, and when the disciples gathered the leftovers, they filled twelve baskets with what remained.

 Jesus, with a gentle yet firm tone, replied, “You’re looking for Me not because you saw signs, but because you ate the bread and were satisfied. Don’t work for food that spoils, but for the food that lasts forever, which the Son of Man will give you.”

 They asked, “What must we do to do the works God requires?”

 Jesus answered, “The work of God is this: to believe in the one He has sent.”

 Still seeking reassurance, they asked, “What sign will You give us so we can believe You? Our ancestors ate manna in the wilderness—what can You do?”

 Jesus kindly responded, “It wasn’t Moses who gave you the bread from heaven, but My Father who gives you the true bread from heaven. The bread of God is the one who comes down from heaven and gives life to the world.”

 With hope in their voices, they said, “Lord, always give us this bread.”

 Jesus then declared, “I am the bread of life. Whoever comes to Me will never go hungry, and whoever believes in Me will never be thirsty. But as I told you, you have seen Me, and still, you don’t believe. All those the Father gives Me will come to Me, and whoever comes to Me, I will never drive away.

 Despite His reassurances, many followers turned back and no longer followed Him. Jesus then asked the twelve disciples, “Do you want to leave too?”

 Simon Peter, with a tone of loyalty and conviction, replied, “Lord, where else would we go? You have the words of eternal life. We believe and know that You are the Holy One of God.”

 Jesus acknowledged their faith but gently reminded them, “Yet one of you is a devil.” He was referring to Judas Iscariot, who would later betray Him.

 Modernized Story with 2024 Dialogue

 Title: The Bread of Life and the Challenge of Faith

 Beginning:
 After doing some pretty amazing things that left everyone talking, Jesus crossed the Sea of Galilee. People had heard all about His miracles, and soon a huge crowd was following Him, hoping to see more. As the Passover feast was coming up, Jesus went up a mountain with His closest friends to hang out and teach them a few things.

 When Jesus looked up, He saw the crowd coming toward them. He turned to Philip and said, “Hey, where do you think we can get enough food to feed all these people?” He already knew what He was going to do, but He wanted to see what Philip would say.

 Philip scratched his head, “Uh, even if we had like, a ton of money, we couldn’t buy enough bread for everyone to have just a bite.”

 Andrew, Simon Peter’s brother, chimed in, “There’s this kid here with five small loaves of bread and a couple of fish, but seriously, what good is that with all these people?”

 Middle:
 Jesus grinned and said, “Okay, have everyone sit down.” So, everyone sat on the grassy hill, about five thousand men, not counting women and kids. Jesus took the loaves of bread, said a prayer of thanks, and started handing them out. He did the same with the fish, and guess what? Everyone ate as much as they wanted!

 When they were all full, Jesus told His disciples, “Gather up the leftovers so nothing goes to waste.” They did, and filled twelve baskets with the pieces left over from those five loaves!

 The crowd was blown away. They started whispering, “This guy must be the prophet we’ve been waiting for!” But Jesus, knowing they might try to make Him king, quietly slipped away to the mountain to be by Himself.

 Later that evening, the disciples got into a boat to cross the sea without Jesus. It got dark, and the wind picked up, making the water really choppy. While they were rowing, they saw someone walking on the water, coming toward them. Freaked out, they thought it was a ghost.

 But then Jesus called out, “Hey, it’s Me! Don’t be scared!” Relieved, they let Him into the boat, and immediately, they reached the shore.

 The next day, the crowd realized Jesus had somehow crossed the sea without a boat, so they hurried to find Him. When they caught up with Him, they asked, “Jesus, how did you get here?”

 End:
 Jesus looked at them and said, “You’re not looking for Me because of the miracles. You just want more bread. But don’t work for food that won’t last; work for the food that gives you eternal life, which I can give you.”

 They asked, “Okay, what do we have to do to do what God wants?”

 Jesus said, “It’s simple—believe in the one God sent.”

 Still curious, they asked, “Can you give us a sign? Our ancestors got bread from heaven. What can you do?”

 Jesus told them, “It wasn’t Moses who gave you bread from heaven; it’s My Father who gives you the true bread from heaven. The bread of God is the one who comes down from heaven and gives life to the world.”

 They said, “Awesome! Give us that bread all the time!”

 Jesus replied, “I am the bread of life. If you come to Me, you’ll never be hungry, and if you believe in Me, you’ll never be thirsty. But like I said, you’ve seen Me, and you still don’t believe. Everyone the Father gives Me will come to Me, and I won’t turn anyone away. I came down from heaven to do what God wants, not what I want.”

 The people started to grumble, “Wait, isn’t this Jesus? We know His parents. How can He say He came from heaven?”

 Jesus, hearing them, said, “Stop complaining. No one can come to Me unless the Father draws them. I’m the living bread that came down from heaven. If anyone eats this bread, they’ll live forever. The bread I’m offering is My life, given for the world.”

 This confused everyone even more, and they argued, “How can He give us His flesh to eat?”

 Jesus didn’t back down. “Unless you eat My flesh and drink My blood, you won’t have life in you. But if you do, you’ll have eternal life, and I’ll raise you up on the last day. My flesh is real food, and My blood is real drink. If you eat My flesh and drink My blood, you’ll stay connected to Me, and I’ll stay connected to you.”

 Hearing this, a lot of His followers were like, “This is too weird. Who can accept this?” Knowing they were struggling, Jesus asked, “Does this freak you out? What if you see the Son of Man go back up to where He was before? The Spirit gives life; the flesh doesn’t count for much. The words I’m speaking are full of Spirit and life.”

 Despite His explanation, many followers decided to leave. Jesus turned to the twelve and asked, “Are you guys going to leave too?”

 Simon Peter answered, “Where else would we go, Lord? You’ve got the words that give eternal life. We believe and know that You are the Holy One of God.”

 Jesus nodded and said, “I chose all twelve of you, didn’t I? But one of you is a devil.” He was talking about Judas Iscariot, who would later betray Him.
 
 
 
 
 
 Modernized Story with 2024 Dialogue

 Title: Jesus and the Feast of Tabernacles

 Beginning:
 After some intense moments where people were out to get Him, Jesus decided to stay in Galilee for a while. He didn’t want to go to Judea just yet because some of the Jewish leaders were planning to kill Him. As the Feast of Tabernacles got closer, His brothers came to Him and said, “Hey, you should go to Judea so your followers can see all the cool stuff you’re doing. No one who wants to be famous does things in secret. If you’re doing these miracles, show the world!”

 But they didn’t really believe in Him, not fully anyway.

 Jesus looked at them and said, “My time hasn’t come yet, but for you, anytime is fine. The world doesn’t hate you, but it hates Me because I point out its wrongs. You go on up to the feast; I’m not going just yet because it’s not My time.”

 After saying that, He stayed back in Galilee for a bit longer.

 Middle:
 When His brothers had gone, Jesus eventually went to the feast too, but He did it quietly, not making a big deal about it. The Jewish leaders were on the lookout for Him at the feast, asking, “Where is He?”

 There was a lot of whispering among the crowds about Jesus. Some said, “He’s a good man,” while others argued, “No, He’s tricking everyone.” But no one talked about Him openly because they were afraid of what the Jewish leaders might do.

 About halfway through the feast, Jesus went up to the temple and started teaching. The Jewish leaders were amazed and said, “How does He know so much without having studied?”

 Jesus told them, “What I’m teaching isn’t My own idea; it comes from the One who sent Me. If anyone really wants to do God’s will, they’ll know whether My teaching comes from God or if I’m just making it up. Anyone who speaks on their own tries to get attention, but someone who seeks to honor the one who sent them is truthful, and there’s nothing false about them. Didn’t Moses give you the law? Yet none of you keep it. So why are you trying to kill Me?”

 The crowd shouted back, “You must be possessed! Who’s trying to kill You?”

 Jesus replied, “I did one miracle, and you’re all shocked. Yet you circumcise a boy on the Sabbath so you don’t break the law of Moses. If a boy can be circumcised on the Sabbath, why are you angry with Me for healing someone on the Sabbath? Stop judging by appearances and make a right judgment.”

 End:
 Some people from Jerusalem started saying, “Isn’t this the guy they’re trying to kill? But look, He’s speaking out in the open, and they’re not saying a thing to Him. Could it be that the authorities really think He’s the Christ? But we know where this guy comes from. When the Christ comes, no one will know where He’s from.”

 Jesus, hearing this, cried out in the temple, “Yes, you know Me, and you know where I’m from. But I’m not here on My own; the One who sent Me is true, and you don’t know Him. I know Him because I’m from Him, and He sent Me.”

 This made them want to grab Him, but no one could lay a hand on Him because His time hadn’t come yet. Still, many in the crowd believed in Him, saying, “When the Christ comes, will He do more miracles than this man?”

 The Pharisees heard the crowd whispering these things about Jesus, so they and the chief priests sent officers to arrest Him. But Jesus said, “I’m only with you for a little while longer, and then I’m going back to the One who sent Me. You’ll look for Me, but you won’t find Me; where I am, you can’t come.”

 The Jewish leaders were confused, saying, “Where’s He planning to go that we can’t find Him? Is He going to teach the Greeks? What does He mean by saying we won’t be able to find Him?”

 On the last and greatest day of the feast, Jesus stood up and shouted, “If anyone is thirsty, let them come to Me and drink. Whoever believes in Me, as Scripture has said, rivers of living water will flow from within them.” (He was talking about the Holy Spirit, which those who believed in Him were later to receive.)

 When the people heard this, some said, “This man is definitely the Prophet.” Others said, “He’s the Christ.” But some argued, “How can the Christ come from Galilee? Doesn’t Scripture say that the Christ will come from David’s family and from Bethlehem, the town where David lived?”

 So there was a lot of disagreement about Him. Some people wanted to arrest Him, but no one laid a hand on Him.

 When the officers returned to the chief priests and Pharisees, they asked, “Why didn’t you bring Him in?”

 The officers replied, “No one ever spoke the way this man does.”

 The Pharisees sneered, “Are you deceived too? Have any of the rulers or Pharisees believed in Him? No, but this mob that knows nothing of the law—there’s a curse on them.”

 Nicodemus, who had earlier visited Jesus, spoke up, “Does our law condemn a man without first hearing him to find out what he’s doing?”

 They shot back, “Are you from Galilee too? Look into it, and you’ll see that no prophet comes out of Galilee.”

 And then everyone went home, still puzzled, still divided.

 Title: Jesus and the Woman, and the Heated Debate in the Temple

 Beginning:
 One early morning, Jesus went to the Mount of Olives to pray. Afterward, He returned to the temple, where a crowd quickly gathered around Him. He sat down and began teaching them, but things took a serious turn when the religious teachers and Pharisees brought in a woman caught in adultery. They made her stand before the crowd and said, “Teacher, this woman was caught in the act of adultery. The law of Moses says we should stone her. What do you say?”

 They were trying to trap Jesus into saying something they could use against Him, but Jesus just bent down and started writing on the ground with His finger. They kept pressing Him, so He stood up and said, “Okay, if any of you have never sinned, you can throw the first stone.”

 Then He bent down again and continued writing on the ground. Slowly, one by one, they all left, starting with the oldest. Eventually, it was just Jesus and the woman standing there.

 Jesus stood up and asked her, “Where are they? Didn’t anyone condemn you?”

 “No one, sir,” she replied.

 “Then I don’t condemn you either,” Jesus said. “Go now, and leave your life of sin.”

 Middle:
 After that, Jesus spoke to the crowd again, saying, “I am the light of the world. Whoever follows Me won’t walk in darkness but will have the light of life.”

 The Pharisees challenged Him, saying, “You’re making these claims about yourself. That doesn’t make them true!”

 Jesus replied, “Even if I do testify about myself, my testimony is valid because I know where I came from and where I’m going. But you don’t know where I come from or where I’m going. You judge by human standards; I don’t judge anyone. But if I do judge, My decisions are true because I’m not alone—I stand with the Father who sent Me. Your own law says that the testimony of two witnesses is true. I am one witness, and My Father who sent Me is the other.”

 “Where is your Father?” they asked.

 Jesus answered, “You don’t know Me or My Father. If you knew Me, you would know My Father too.”

 He said all this while teaching in the temple, yet no one arrested Him because His time hadn’t come yet.

 Later, Jesus told them, “I’m going away, and you will look for Me, but you’ll die in your sins. Where I go, you can’t come.”

 This confused the people, and they wondered, “Is He going to kill Himself? Why does He say we can’t go where He’s going?”

 Jesus continued, “You are from below; I am from above. You belong to this world; I do not. That’s why I told you that you would die in your sins; for unless you believe that I am who I claim to be, you will die in your sins.”

 “Who are you?” they demanded.

 “I am who I have been telling you from the beginning,” Jesus replied. “I have much to say about you and much to judge, but He who sent Me is trustworthy, and I only say what I have heard from Him.”

 They still didn’t understand that He was talking about God the Father. So Jesus added, “When you have lifted up the Son of Man, then you will know that I am He and that I do nothing on My own but speak just what the Father has taught Me. The One who sent Me is with Me; He has not left Me alone, for I always do what pleases Him.”

 As He spoke, many believed in Him.

 End:
 Jesus then turned to those who believed and said, “If you hold to My teaching, you are really My disciples. Then you will know the truth, and the truth will set you free.”

 They answered, “We are Abraham’s descendants and have never been slaves to anyone. How can you say that we shall be set free?”

 Jesus replied, “Very truly I tell you, everyone who sins is a slave to sin. Now a slave has no permanent place in the family, but a son belongs to it forever. So if the Son sets you free, you will be free indeed. I know you are Abraham’s descendants, yet you are looking for a way to kill Me because you have no room for My word. I am telling you what I have seen in the Father’s presence, and you are doing what you have heard from your father.”

 “Our father is Abraham,” they declared.

 “No,” Jesus said, “if you were Abraham’s children, you would do what Abraham did. But instead, you are trying to kill Me, a man who has told you the truth that I heard from God. Abraham didn’t do that. You are doing the works of your own father.”

 “We’re not illegitimate children,” they protested. “The only Father we have is God Himself.”

 Jesus said to them, “If God were your Father, you would love Me, for I have come here from God. I have not come on My own; God sent Me. Why is My language not clear to you? Because you are unable to hear what I say. You belong to your father, the devil, and you want to carry out your father’s desires. He was a murderer from the beginning, not holding to the truth, for there is no truth in him. When he lies, he speaks his native language, for he is a liar and the father of lies. Yet because I tell the truth, you do not believe Me! Can any of you prove Me guilty of sin? If I am telling the truth, why don’t you believe Me? Whoever belongs to God hears what God says. The reason you do not hear is that you do not belong to God.”

 The people retorted, “Aren’t we right in saying that You are a Samaritan and demon-possessed?”

 “I am not possessed by a demon,” said Jesus, “but I honor My Father, and you dishonor Me. I am not seeking glory for Myself; but there is one who seeks it, and He is the judge. Very truly I tell you, whoever obeys My word will never see death.”

 At this, they exclaimed, “Now we know that You are demon-possessed! Abraham died and so did the prophets, yet You say that whoever obeys Your word will never taste death. Are You greater than our father Abraham? He died, and so did the prophets. Who do You think You are?”

 Jesus replied, “If I glorify Myself, My glory means nothing. My Father, whom you claim as your God, is the one who glorifies Me. Though you do not know Him, I know Him. If I said I did not, I would be a liar like you, but I do know Him and obey His word. Your father Abraham rejoiced at the thought of seeing My day; he saw it and was glad.”

 “You are not yet fifty years old,” they said to Him, “and You have seen Abraham?”

 “Very truly I tell you,” Jesus answered, “before Abraham was born, I am!”

 At this, they picked up stones to stone Him, but Jesus hid Himself, slipping away from the temple grounds.

 Title: The Blind Man Who Could Finally See

 Beginning:
 One day, as Jesus was walking along, He noticed a man who had been blind since birth. His disciples, curious about why the man was born blind, asked, “Jesus, who messed up—this guy or his parents—that he was born blind?”

 Jesus replied, “Neither this man nor his parents sinned. This happened so that the works of God could be shown in his life. While I’m here, I’ve got to do the work of the One who sent Me. Night is coming when no one can work. As long as I’m in the world, I’m the light of the world.”

 After saying that, Jesus spit on the ground, made some mud with the saliva, and spread it on the man’s eyes. Then He told him, “Go, wash in the pool of Siloam.” The man went, washed the mud off, and came back able to see for the first time in his life!

 Middle:
 When his neighbors and others who had seen him begging realized he could see, they couldn’t believe it. They said, “Isn’t this the guy who used to sit and beg?”

 Some said, “Yeah, that’s him,” while others said, “Nah, it just looks like him.”

 But the man kept saying, “It’s me! I’m the guy!”

 They asked him, “How can you see now?”

 He replied, “This guy named Jesus made some mud, put it on my eyes, and told me to go wash in the pool of Siloam. So I went, washed it off, and now I can see!”

 “Where is He?” they asked.

 “I don’t know,” the man replied.

 So they brought him to the Pharisees, since it was the Sabbath when Jesus had healed him. The Pharisees also asked him how he had received his sight. He told them, “He put mud on my eyes, I washed it off, and now I can see.”

 Some of the Pharisees said, “This man isn’t from God, because He doesn’t keep the Sabbath.”

 But others asked, “How can a sinner do such miraculous things?” So they were divided.

 They turned to the man who had been blind and asked, “What do you say about Him? After all, He opened your eyes.”

 The man replied, “He’s a prophet.”

 End:
 The Jewish leaders still didn’t believe that he had been blind and gained his sight until they called his parents. They asked them, “Is this your son? Was he born blind? How can he see now?”

 His parents answered, “We know this is our son, and we know he was born blind. But we have no idea how he can see now or who opened his eyes. He’s old enough—ask him. He can speak for himself.”

 His parents said this because they were afraid of the Jewish leaders, who had already decided that anyone who acknowledged Jesus as the Christ would be kicked out of the synagogue. That’s why they said, “Ask him; he’s of age.”

 So the Jewish leaders called the man back a second time and said, “Give glory to God by telling the truth. We know this man is a sinner.”

 The man replied, “Whether He’s a sinner or not, I don’t know. One thing I do know: I was blind, and now I see!”

 They asked him again, “What did He do to you? How did He open your eyes?”

 He answered, “I already told you, and you didn’t listen. Why do you want to hear it again? Do you want to become His disciples too?”

 They hurled insults at him and said, “You’re this fellow’s disciple! We’re disciples of Moses! We know that God spoke to Moses, but as for this guy, we don’t even know where He comes from.”

 The man answered, “Now that’s remarkable! You don’t know where He comes from, yet He opened my eyes. We know that God doesn’t listen to sinners. He listens to the godly person who does His will. Nobody has ever heard of opening the eyes of a man born blind. If this man weren’t from God, He couldn’t do anything.”

 To this, they replied, “You were steeped in sin at birth; how dare you lecture us!” And they threw him out.

 When Jesus heard that they had thrown him out, He found the man and asked, “Do you believe in the Son of God?”

 “Who is He, sir?” the man asked. “Tell me so that I may believe in Him.”

 Jesus said, “You have now seen Him; in fact, He is the one speaking with you.”

 Then the man said, “Lord, I believe,” and he worshiped Him.

 Jesus said, “I came into this world for judgment, so that the blind will see and those who see will become blind.”

 Some Pharisees who were with Him heard Him say this and asked, “What? Are we blind too?”

 Jesus said, “If you were blind, you wouldn’t be guilty of sin; but now that you claim you can see, your guilt remains.”

 Title: The Good Shepherd and the Unbelieving Crowd

 Beginning:
 Jesus was talking with His followers when He shared a story: “Listen up. If someone tries to sneak into a sheep pen without going through the gate, that person is nothing but a thief or a robber. But the one who enters by the gate is the shepherd. The gatekeeper opens the gate for him, and the sheep recognize his voice. He calls his own sheep by name and leads them out. When he has brought out all his own, he goes ahead of them, and the sheep follow him because they know his voice. They won’t follow a stranger; they’ll run away from him because they don’t recognize the voice of strangers.”

 But the people didn’t really get what Jesus was trying to say, so He explained it more clearly: “I’m telling you, I am the gate for the sheep. All who came before me were thieves and robbers, but the sheep didn’t listen to them. I am the gate; whoever enters through me will be saved. They will come in and go out and find pasture. The thief comes only to steal, kill, and destroy; I have come that they may have life, and have it to the full.

 I am the good shepherd. The good shepherd lays down his life for the sheep. A hired hand, who is not the shepherd and doesn’t own the sheep, sees the wolf coming, abandons the sheep, and runs away. Then the wolf attacks the flock and scatters it. The man runs away because he’s only hired and doesn’t care about the sheep. I am the good shepherd; I know my sheep, and my sheep know me—just as the Father knows me, and I know the Father—and I lay down my life for the sheep.”

 Middle:
 Jesus continued, “I have other sheep that are not of this sheep pen. I must bring them also. They too will listen to my voice, and there shall be one flock and one shepherd. The reason my Father loves me is that I lay down my life—only to take it up again. No one takes it from me, but I lay it down of my own accord. I have the authority to lay it down and the authority to take it up again. This command I received from my Father.”

 After Jesus said all this, the crowd started arguing among themselves again. Some of them said, “He’s possessed by a demon and out of his mind. Why listen to him?” But others said, “These aren’t the words of someone possessed by a demon. Can a demon open the eyes of the blind?”

 It was winter, and the Festival of Dedication was happening in Jerusalem. Jesus was walking in the temple courts, in Solomon’s Colonnade, when some people surrounded Him and asked, “How long are you going to keep us in suspense? If you’re the Messiah, just tell us plainly.”

 End:
 Jesus replied, “I’ve already told you, but you don’t believe. The works I do in my Father’s name testify about me, but you don’t believe because you’re not my sheep. My sheep listen to my voice; I know them, and they follow me. I give them eternal life, and they shall never perish; no one will snatch them out of my hand. My Father, who has given them to me, is greater than all; no one can snatch them out of my Father’s hand. I and the Father are one.”

 The people picked up stones to throw at Him, but Jesus asked, “I’ve shown you many good works from the Father; for which of these do you stone me?”

 They answered, “We’re not stoning you for any good work but for blasphemy because you, a mere man, claim to be God.”

 Jesus responded, “Isn’t it written in your law, ‘I have said you are gods’? If he called them ‘gods,’ to whom the word of God came—and Scripture cannot be broken—what about the one whom the Father set apart as his very own and sent into the world? Why then do you accuse me of blasphemy because I said, ‘I am God’s Son’? Do not believe me unless I do the works of my Father. But if I do them, even though you don’t believe me, believe the works, that you may know and understand that the Father is in me, and I in the Father.”

 Once again, they tried to seize Him, but He slipped away from their grasp.

 Jesus then went back across the Jordan to the place where John had been baptizing in the early days. He stayed there, and many people came to Him. They said, “Though John never performed a sign, all that John said about this man was true.” And many believed in Jesus there.

 Modernized Story with 2024 Dialogue

 Title: Lazarus, Come Forth!

 Beginning:
 There was a man named Lazarus who lived in Bethany, the same town as Mary and her sister Martha. (This was the Mary who had poured perfume on the Lord and wiped His feet with her hair.) Lazarus, their brother, was really sick. So the sisters sent a message to Jesus, saying, “Lord, the one you love is sick.”

 When Jesus heard this, He said, “This sickness won’t end in death. It’s for God’s glory so that the Son of God can be glorified through it.” Jesus loved Martha, Mary, and Lazarus, so when He heard that Lazarus was sick, He stayed where He was for two more days. Then He said to His disciples, “Let’s go back to Judea.”

 But the disciples were worried. They said, “Teacher, the Jewish leaders were just trying to stone you, and you want to go back there?”

 Jesus replied, “Aren’t there twelve hours of daylight? Anyone who walks in the daytime won’t stumble, because they can see by this world’s light. But if anyone walks at night, they stumble, because they have no light.”

 After He said this, He told them, “Our friend Lazarus has fallen asleep, but I’m going there to wake him up.”

 The disciples didn’t quite get it and said, “Lord, if he’s sleeping, he’ll get better.”

 Jesus was talking about Lazarus’s death, but they thought He meant natural sleep. So then He told them plainly, “Lazarus is dead, and for your sake, I’m glad I wasn’t there so that you may believe. But let’s go to him.”

 Then Thomas, nicknamed the Twin, said to the other disciples, “Let’s go too, so we can die with Him.”

 Middle:
 When Jesus arrived, He found that Lazarus had already been in the tomb for four days. Bethany was close to Jerusalem, about two miles away, and many Jews had come to comfort Martha and Mary in their loss. When Martha heard that Jesus was coming, she went out to meet Him, but Mary stayed at home.

 “Lord,” Martha said to Jesus, “if you had been here, my brother wouldn’t have died. But even now I know that God will give you whatever you ask.”

 Jesus told her, “Your brother will rise again.”

 Martha answered, “I know he’ll rise again in the resurrection at the last day.”

 Jesus said to her, “I am the resurrection and the life. The one who believes in me will live, even though they die; and whoever lives by believing in me will never die. Do you believe this?”

 “Yes, Lord,” she replied. “I believe that you are the Messiah, the Son of God, who is to come into the world.”

 After she said this, she went back and called her sister Mary aside. “The Teacher is here,” she said, “and is asking for you.”

 When Mary heard this, she got up quickly and went to Him. Jesus hadn’t yet entered the village but was still at the place where Martha had met Him. When the Jews who had been comforting Mary saw her get up quickly and go out, they followed her, thinking she was going to the tomb to mourn there.

 When Mary reached the place where Jesus was and saw Him, she fell at His feet and said, “Lord, if you had been here, my brother wouldn’t have died.”

 When Jesus saw her weeping, and the Jews who had come along with her also weeping, He was deeply moved in spirit and troubled. “Where have you laid him?” He asked.

 “Come and see, Lord,” they replied.

 Jesus wept.

 Then the Jews said, “See how He loved him!”

 But some of them said, “Couldn’t He who opened the eyes of the blind man have kept this man from dying?”

 End:
 Jesus, once more deeply moved, came to the tomb. It was a cave with a stone laid across the entrance. “Take away the stone,” He said.

 “But, Lord,” said Martha, the sister of the dead man, “by this time there’s a bad odor, for he’s been there four days.”

 Then Jesus said, “Did I not tell you that if you believe, you will see the glory of God?”

 So they took away the stone. Then Jesus looked up and said, “Father, I thank you that you have heard me. I knew that you always hear me, but I said this for the benefit of the people standing here, that they may believe that you sent me.”

 When He had said this, Jesus called in a loud voice, “Lazarus, come out!”

 The dead man came out, his hands and feet wrapped with strips of linen, and a cloth around his face. Jesus said to them, “Take off the grave clothes and let him go.”

 Many of the Jews who had come to visit Mary and had seen what Jesus did believed in Him. But some of them went to the Pharisees and told them what Jesus had done.

 Then the chief priests and the Pharisees called a meeting of the Sanhedrin. “What are we accomplishing?” they asked. “Here is this man performing many signs. If we let him go on like this, everyone will believe in him, and then the Romans will come and take away both our temple and our nation.”

 Then one of them, named Caiaphas, who was high priest that year, spoke up, “You don’t know anything at all! You do not realize that it is better for you that one man die for the people than that the whole nation perish.”

 He did not say this on his own, but as high priest that year he prophesied that Jesus would die for the Jewish nation, and not only for that nation but also for the scattered children of God, to bring them together and make them one. So from that day on, they plotted to take His life.

 Therefore Jesus no longer moved about publicly among the people of Judea. Instead, He withdrew to a region near the wilderness, to a village called Ephraim, where He stayed with His disciples.

 When it was almost time for the Jewish Passover, many went up from the country to Jerusalem for their ceremonial cleansing before the Passover. They kept looking for Jesus, and as they stood in the temple courts, they asked one another, “What do you think? Isn’t He coming to the festival at all?”

 But the chief priests and the Pharisees had given orders that anyone who found out where Jesus was should report it so that they might arrest Him.
 
 
 
 Modernized Story with 2024 Dialogue

 Title: The Last Supper and the New Commandment

 Beginning:
 It was just before the Passover, and Jesus knew that the time had come for Him to leave this world and return to the Father. He had loved His followers deeply, and now, as the end approached, He continued to show them the full extent of His love.

 The evening meal was in progress, and the devil had already convinced Judas Iscariot, the son of Simon, to betray Jesus. Jesus knew that the Father had put all things under His control, and that He had come from God and was returning to God. So, He got up from the meal, took off His outer clothing, and wrapped a towel around His waist. After that, He poured water into a basin and began to wash the disciples’ feet, drying them with the towel that was wrapped around Him.

 When He came to Simon Peter, Peter said to Him, “Lord, are You going to wash my feet?”

 Jesus replied, “You don’t realize now what I’m doing, but later you’ll understand.”

 “No,” said Peter, “You shall never wash my feet.”

 Jesus answered, “Unless I wash you, you have no part with me.”

 “Then, Lord,” Simon Peter replied, “not just my feet but my hands and my head as well!”

 Jesus answered, “Those who have had a bath need only to wash their feet; their whole body is clean. And you are clean, though not every one of you.” For He knew who was going to betray Him, and that was why He said not everyone was clean.

 Middle:
 When He had finished washing their feet, He put on His clothes and returned to His place. “Do you understand what I have done for you?” He asked them. “You call me ‘Teacher’ and ‘Lord,’ and rightly so, for that is what I am. Now that I, your Lord and Teacher, have washed your feet, you also should wash one another’s feet. I have set you an example that you should do as I have done for you. Very truly I tell you, no servant is greater than his master, nor is a messenger greater than the one who sent him. Now that you know these things, you will be blessed if you do them.

 “I’m not referring to all of you; I know those I have chosen. But this is to fulfill the Scripture: ‘He who shared my bread has turned against me.’ I’m telling you now before it happens, so that when it does happen you will believe that I am who I am. Very truly I tell you, whoever accepts anyone I send accepts me; and whoever accepts me accepts the one who sent me.”

 After He had said this, Jesus was troubled in spirit and declared, “Very truly I tell you, one of you is going to betray me.”

 His disciples stared at one another, at a loss to know which of them He meant. One of them, the disciple whom Jesus loved, was reclining next to Him. Simon Peter motioned to this disciple and said, “Ask Him which one He means.”

 Leaning back against Jesus, he asked Him, “Lord, who is it?”

 Jesus answered, “It’s the one to whom I will give this piece of bread when I have dipped it in the dish.” Then, dipping the piece of bread, He gave it to Judas, the son of Simon Iscariot. As soon as Judas took the bread, Satan entered into him.

 So Jesus told him, “What you are about to do, do quickly.” But no one at the meal understood why Jesus said this to him. Since Judas had charge of the money, some thought Jesus was telling him to buy what was needed for the festival, or to give something to the poor. As soon as Judas had taken the bread, he went out. And it was night.

 End:
 When he was gone, Jesus said, “Now the Son of Man is glorified and God is glorified in Him. If God is glorified in Him, God will glorify the Son in Himself, and will glorify Him at once.

 “My children, I will be with you only a little longer. You will look for me, and just as I told the Jews, so I tell you now: Where I am going, you cannot come. A new command I give you: Love one another. As I have loved you, so you must love one another. By this everyone will know that you are my disciples if you love one another.”

 Simon Peter asked Him, “Lord, where are You going?”

 Jesus replied, “Where I am going, you cannot follow now, but you will follow later.”

 Peter asked, “Lord, why can’t I follow You now? I will lay down my life for You.”

 Then Jesus answered, “Will you really lay down your life for me? Very truly I tell you, before the rooster crows, you will disown me three times.”
 
 
 
 
 
 
 Title: The Promise of Comfort and Peace

 Beginning:
 Jesus gathered His disciples and could see the concern in their eyes, knowing what lay ahead. “Don’t let your hearts be troubled,” He began. “You believe in God; believe also in me. In my Father’s house, there are many rooms. If it weren’t so, would I have told you that I’m going to prepare a place for you? And if I go and prepare a place for you, I will come back and take you with me so that you can be where I am. You already know the way to the place I’m going.”

 Thomas, always practical, spoke up, “Lord, we don’t know where you’re going, so how can we know the way?”

 Jesus answered him, “I am the way, the truth, and the life. No one comes to the Father except through me. If you really know me, you’ll know my Father as well. From now on, you do know Him and have seen Him.”

 Philip, still not fully grasping it, asked, “Lord, show us the Father, and that will be enough for us.”

 Jesus looked at him and said, “Philip, have I been with you all this time, and you still don’t know me? Anyone who has seen me has seen the Father. So how can you say, ‘Show us the Father’? Don’t you believe that I am in the Father and the Father is in me? The words I speak to you, I don’t speak on my own authority. Rather, it’s the Father, living in me, who is doing His work. Believe me when I say that I am in the Father and the Father is in me; or at least believe on the evidence of the works themselves.”

 Middle:
 Jesus continued, “Very truly I tell you, whoever believes in me will do the works I have been doing, and they will do even greater things than these because I am going to the Father. And I will do whatever you ask in my name, so that the Father may be glorified in the Son. If you ask anything in my name, I will do it. If you love me, keep my commands. And I will ask the Father, and He will give you another Helper to be with you forever—the Spirit of truth. The world can’t accept Him because it neither sees Him nor knows Him. But you know Him, for He lives with you and will be in you.

 I’m not going to leave you alone like orphans; I will come to you. Before long, the world won’t see me anymore, but you will see me. Because I live, you also will live. On that day, you’ll realize that I am in my Father, and you are in me, and I am in you. Whoever has my commands and keeps them is the one who loves me. The one who loves me will be loved by my Father, and I too will love them and show myself to them.”

 Judas (not Iscariot) asked, “Lord, why do you intend to show yourself to us and not to the world?”

 Jesus replied, “Anyone who loves me will obey my teaching. My Father will love them, and we will come to them and make our home with them. Anyone who doesn’t love me won’t obey my teaching. These words you hear aren’t my own; they belong to the Father who sent me. All this I’ve spoken while still with you, but the Advocate, the Holy Spirit, whom the Father will send in my name, will teach you all things and remind you of everything I’ve said to you.”

 End:
 “Peace I leave with you; my peace I give you. I don’t give to you as the world gives. Don’t let your hearts be troubled, and don’t be afraid. You heard me say, ‘I am going away and I am coming back to you.’ If you loved me, you would be glad that I’m going to the Father, for the Father is greater than I. I have told you now before it happens so that when it does happen, you will believe. I will not say much more to you, for the prince of this world is coming. He has no hold over me, but he comes so that the world may learn that I love the Father and do exactly what my Father has commanded me. Come now; let’s leave.”
 
 
 
 
 
 
 Modernized Story with 2024 Dialogue

 Title: The Vine, the Branches, and the Commandment of Love

 Beginning:
 Jesus gathered His disciples close and began to teach them with a powerful metaphor: “I am the true vine, and my Father is the gardener. He cuts off every branch in me that bears no fruit, while every branch that does bear fruit He prunes so that it will be even more fruitful. You are already clean because of the word I have spoken to you. Remain in me, as I also remain in you. No branch can bear fruit by itself; it must remain in the vine. Neither can you bear fruit unless you remain in me.

 I am the vine; you are the branches. If you remain in me and I in you, you will bear much fruit; apart from me, you can do nothing. If you do not remain in me, you are like a branch that is thrown away and withers; such branches are picked up, thrown into the fire, and burned. If you remain in me and my words remain in you, ask whatever you wish, and it will be done for you. This is to my Father’s glory, that you bear much fruit, showing yourselves to be my disciples.”

 Middle:
 “As the Father has loved me, so have I loved you. Now remain in my love. If you keep my commands, you will remain in my love, just as I have kept my Father’s commands and remain in His love. I have told you this so that my joy may be in you and that your joy may be complete.

 This is my command: Love each other as I have loved you. Greater love has no one than this: to lay down one’s life for one’s friends. You are my friends if you do what I command. I no longer call you servants, because a servant does not know his master’s business. Instead, I have called you friends, for everything that I learned from my Father I have made known to you. You did not choose me, but I chose you and appointed you so that you might go and bear fruit—fruit that will last—and so that whatever you ask in my name the Father will give you. This is my command: Love each other.”

 End:
 “If the world hates you, keep in mind that it hated me first. If you belonged to the world, it would love you as its own. As it is, you do not belong to the world, but I have chosen you out of the world. That is why the world hates you. Remember what I told you: ‘A servant is not greater than his master.’ If they persecuted me, they will persecute you also. If they obeyed my teaching, they will obey yours also. They will treat you this way because of my name, for they do not know the one who sent me.

 If I had not come and spoken to them, they would not be guilty of sin; but now they have no excuse for their sin. Whoever hates me hates my Father as well. If I had not done among them the works no one else did, they would not be guilty of sin. As it is, they have seen, and yet they have hated both me and my Father. But this is to fulfill what is written in their law: ‘They hated me without reason.’

 When the Advocate comes, whom I will send to you from the Father—the Spirit of truth who goes out from the Father—He will testify about me. And you also must testify, for you have been with me from the beginning.”
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 Title: The Vine and the Branches: A Lesson in Staying Connected

 Beginning:
 One day, Jesus was hanging out with His friends, and He decided to teach them something important in a way they could easily get. “Hey, guys, think of me as a vine, and God, my Dad, is the gardener. Every branch connected to me that doesn’t bear fruit, He cuts off. But every branch that does bear fruit, He prunes so it can produce even more. You’re already clean because of the words I’ve spoken to you. So, stay connected to me, and I’ll stay connected to you. Just like a branch can’t produce fruit unless it’s connected to the vine, you can’t do anything unless you stay connected to me.

 I’m the vine, and you’re the branches. If you stay connected to me, and I’m connected to you, you’ll bear a lot of fruit. But without me, you can’t do anything. If you don’t stay connected to me, you’re like a branch that’s been cut off and withered—people gather those and throw them into the fire. But if you stay connected to me, and my words stay in you, you can ask for anything you want, and it’ll be done for you. This makes God happy when you bear lots of fruit and show that you’re my disciples.”

 Middle:
 Jesus continued, “As God loves me, I’ve loved you, too. So stay in my love. If you keep my commandments, you’ll stay in my love, just like I keep my Dad’s commandments and stay in His love. I’m telling you this so that my joy can be in you, and your joy can be complete.

 Here’s my command: Love each other just like I’ve loved you. There’s no greater love than when someone lays down their life for their friends. You’re my friends if you do what I command. I don’t call you servants anymore, because servants don’t know their master’s business. Instead, I call you friends, because everything I learned from my Dad, I’ve shared with you. You didn’t choose me, but I chose you and appointed you to go and bear fruit—fruit that will last. So whatever you ask in my name, my Dad will give you. This is my command: Love each other.”

 End:
 Jesus then gave them a heads-up, “If the world hates you, remember that it hated me first. If you belonged to the world, it would love you as its own. But since you don’t belong to the world—and I chose you out of it—that’s why the world hates you. Remember what I told you: A servant isn’t greater than his master. If they persecuted me, they’ll persecute you too. If they listened to me, they’ll listen to you. They’ll do all this to you because of me, because they don’t know the one who sent me.

 If I hadn’t come and spoken to them, they wouldn’t be guilty of sin; but now they have no excuse. Whoever hates me also hates my Dad. If I hadn’t done among them the works that no one else did, they wouldn’t be guilty of sin. But now they’ve seen, and yet they’ve hated both me and my Dad. But this is to fulfill what’s written in their law: ‘They hated me without reason.’

 When the Helper comes—the Holy Spirit, whom I’ll send to you from God, my Dad—He will testify about me. And you must also testify, because you’ve been with me from the start.”
 
 
 
 
 
 
 Retelling of the Passage in 2024 with a Casual, Contemporary Tone

 Title: Hard Times, Good News, and the Ultimate Comfort

 Beginning:
 Jesus was sitting with His disciples, and He could see that they were worried about everything He had been telling them. So He started, “I’m sharing all this with you so you won’t be caught off guard. There’s going to be a time when people will kick you out of places you thought were safe, like your synagogues. And believe it or not, there will even be people who think they’re doing God a favor by hurting you. They’ll do these things because they don’t really know God or me.

 But I’m telling you this now so that when it happens, you’ll remember I warned you. I didn’t tell you all this at the start because I was here with you. But now I’m going back to the One who sent me, and none of you are asking me where I’m going. I can see that what I’ve said is making you sad.”

 Middle:
 “But here’s the truth,” Jesus continued, “It’s actually better for you that I go away. If I don’t, the Comforter—the Holy Spirit—won’t come. But if I do go, I’ll send Him to you. When He comes, He’ll show the world the truth about sin, about what’s right, and about judgment. He’ll prove the world wrong about sin because they don’t believe in me, right about righteousness because I’m going to the Father and you won’t see me anymore, and judgment because the prince of this world stands condemned.

 There’s so much more I want to tell you, but you’re not ready to handle it all right now. But when the Spirit of truth comes, He’ll guide you into all the truth. He won’t speak on His own; He’ll speak only what He hears, and He’ll tell you what’s going to happen. He’ll glorify me by taking what’s mine and making it known to you. Everything that belongs to the Father is mine. That’s why I said the Spirit will take what’s mine and show it to you.”

 End:
 “In just a little while, you won’t see me anymore, but then after a little while, you will see me again,” Jesus said. This made the disciples whisper among themselves, trying to figure out what He meant. They were like, “What’s this ‘little while’ stuff? We don’t get it.”

 Jesus knew they were confused, so He explained, “You’re going to be really sad soon, while the world celebrates. But hang in there—your sadness will turn into joy. It’s like when a woman is having a baby—she’s in pain, but once the baby is born, she forgets the pain because of the joy that a new life has come into the world. That’s how it’ll be for you. You’re sad now, but I’ll see you again, and your hearts will be full of joy, and no one can take that joy away from you.

 On that day, you won’t need to ask me anything. I tell you the truth, whatever you ask the Father in my name, He’ll give you. Up until now, you haven’t asked for anything in my name. Ask and you’ll receive, and your joy will be complete. I’ve been using figures of speech, but a time is coming when I won’t do that anymore—I’ll tell you plainly about the Father. When that time comes, you’ll ask in my name. I’m not saying I’ll ask the Father on your behalf, because the Father Himself loves you. He loves you because you’ve loved me and believed that I came from God. I came from the Father and entered the world; now I’m leaving the world and going back to the Father.”

 Finally, the disciples thought they understood and said, “Now you’re speaking plainly, Jesus! We get it now—you know everything, and that’s why we believe you came from God.”

 Jesus responded, “Oh, so now you believe? But listen, the time is coming, in fact, it’s here, when you’ll be scattered, each to your own home, and you’ll leave me all alone. But I’m not really alone, because the Father is with me. I’ve told you all this so that you’ll have peace in me. In this world, you’re going to face some tough times. But don’t worry—I’ve already won the victory over the world!”

 Title: Tough Times and Good News

 Beginning:
 Jesus was sitting with His friends, and He could tell they were starting to feel nervous about everything He’d been saying. He looked at them and said, “Listen, I’m telling you all this so you won’t freak out when things get tough. There’s going to be a time when people will kick you out of places you thought were safe, like your churches. Some people might even think they’re doing the right thing by hurting you because they don’t really know God or me.

 But I’m giving you a heads-up now so that when it happens, you’ll remember that I told you this was coming. I didn’t tell you everything at the start because I was right here with you. But now I’m going back to the One who sent me, and you guys haven’t really asked me where I’m going. I get it, though—what I’ve said has made you pretty sad.”

 Middle:
 “But here’s the thing,” Jesus continued, “It’s actually better for you that I go away. If I don’t, the Helper—the Holy Spirit—won’t come. But if I go, I’ll send Him to you. When He gets here, He’ll show the world what’s really right and wrong and what’s going to happen. He’ll show the world they’re wrong about sin because they don’t believe in me, what’s right because I’m going back to God and you won’t see me anymore, and about judgment because the bad guy—Satan—has already lost.

 There’s so much more I want to tell you, but you’re not ready to handle it all right now. But when the Spirit of truth comes, He’ll guide you into all the truth. He won’t make stuff up; He’ll tell you what He hears, and He’ll even show you what’s coming next. He’ll make me look good by taking what’s mine and sharing it with you. Everything that belongs to God belongs to me too. That’s why I said the Spirit will take what’s mine and show it to you.”

 End:
 “In just a little while, you won’t see me anymore, but then after a bit, you’ll see me again,” Jesus said. His friends started whispering to each other, “What does He mean by ‘a little while’? We don’t get it.”

 Jesus noticed they were confused and said, “You’re going to be really sad soon, while the world is happy. But don’t worry—your sadness will turn into happiness. It’s like when a mom is having a baby—she’s in a lot of pain, but once the baby is born, she’s so happy she forgets about the pain. That’s how it’ll be for you. You’re sad now, but when I see you again, you’ll be so happy, and no one can take that joy away from you.

 When that happens, you won’t need to ask me for anything. I’m telling you the truth, whatever you ask God for in my name, He’ll give it to you. Until now, you haven’t asked for anything in my name. But go ahead, ask and you’ll get it, and your happiness will be full. I’ve been using tricky sayings, but soon I’ll stop and just tell you straight up about God. When that time comes, you’ll ask in my name. I’m not saying I’ll ask God for you, because He already loves you. He loves you because you’ve loved me and believed that I came from Him. I came from God and came into the world; now I’m leaving the world and going back to God.”

 Finally, His friends thought they understood and said, “Okay, now you’re talking clearly, Jesus! We get it now—you know everything, and that’s why we believe you came from God.”

 Jesus smiled and said, “Oh, so now you believe? But listen, the time is coming, and it’s actually here now, when you’ll all scatter to your own homes and leave me alone. But I’m not really alone, because God is with me. I’m telling you all this so that you’ll have peace in me. In this world, you’re going to have some hard times. But don’t worry—I’ve already won the battle against the world!”

 Title: Jesus’ Big Prayer

 Beginning:
 One day, Jesus looked up to the sky and started talking to God, saying, “Dad, it’s time. Show everyone how awesome I am, so I can show how awesome You are. You’ve given me the power to give eternal life to everyone You’ve entrusted to me. And here’s what eternal life is all about: it’s knowing You, the only real God, and knowing me, Jesus Christ, the one You sent.

 I’ve done everything You asked me to do here on Earth. I’ve shown people how great You are. Now, Dad, give me the glory I had with You before the world even existed.”

 Middle:
 “I’ve shown Your name to the people You gave me out of this world. They belonged to You, and You gave them to me, and they’ve followed Your word. They know now that everything I have comes from You. I’ve given them the words You gave me, and they’ve accepted them. They know for sure that I came from You, and they believe You sent me.

 I’m praying for them now, not for the whole world, but just for the ones You’ve given me, because they belong to You. Everything that’s mine is Yours, and everything that’s Yours is mine, and they bring glory to me. I’m not going to be in the world much longer, but they’re still going to be here, so I’m coming back to You. Holy Father, protect them by the power of Your name—the name You gave me—so that they may be one, just like We are one.”

 End:
 “While I was with them, I kept them safe by that name You gave me. I protected them, and not one of them was lost except the one who chose to go the wrong way, just like the Scriptures said. Now I’m coming back to You, but I’m saying all this while I’m still in the world, so that they can have the full measure of my joy inside them.

 I’ve given them Your word, and the world has hated them because they’re not of the world, just like I’m not of the world. I’m not asking You to take them out of the world, but to keep them safe from the evil one. They don’t belong to the world, just like I don’t. Make them holy by Your truth; Your word is truth. Just as You sent me into the world, I’m sending them into the world. For their sake, I make myself holy, so that they too may be truly holy.

 I’m not just praying for them, but also for everyone who will believe in me because of their message. I pray that all of them may be one, just as You are in me and I am in You. May they also be in Us so that the world will believe You sent me. I’ve given them the glory that You gave me, so they may be one as We are one—I in them and You in me—so that they may be brought to complete unity. Then the world will know that You sent me and have loved them even as You have loved me.

 Dad, I want those You’ve given me to be with me where I am and to see my glory, the glory You’ve given me because You loved me before the world was even made. Righteous Father, though the world doesn’t know You, I know You, and they know that You sent me. I have made You known to them, and I’ll continue to make You known so that the love You have for me may be in them, and that I myself may be in them.”

 Title: The Night Jesus Was Arrested

 Beginning:
 After Jesus finished talking to His friends, He led them across a small stream called the Kidron Valley to a garden where they often hung out. Judas, who was going to betray Him, knew this spot well because they’d been there many times before. Judas had made a deal with the religious leaders and showed up with a bunch of soldiers and guards carrying lanterns, torches, and weapons.

 Jesus, knowing everything that was about to happen, stepped forward and asked, “Who are you looking for?”
 They replied, “Jesus of Nazareth.”
 Jesus said, “I’m the one.” When He said that, everyone stepped back and fell to the ground.

 Middle:
 Jesus asked them again, “Who are you looking for?”
 They repeated, “Jesus of Nazareth.”
 Jesus said, “I already told you, I’m the one. So if it’s me you want, let these other guys go.” This happened to make sure that what He had said earlier about not losing any of His followers would come true.

 At that moment, Peter, one of Jesus’ friends, pulled out a sword and swung it at a servant of the high priest, cutting off his ear. The servant’s name was Malchus. But Jesus told Peter, “Put your sword away! Shouldn’t I go through with what my Father has planned for me?”

 End:
 Then the soldiers, their commander, and the guards arrested Jesus and tied Him up. They first took Him to Annas, the father-in-law of Caiaphas, who was the high priest that year. Caiaphas was the one who had suggested that it would be better for one man to die for the people.

 Meanwhile, Peter and another disciple followed Jesus. The other disciple was known to the high priest, so he was able to go with Jesus into the courtyard. But Peter had to stay outside by the door until the other disciple talked to the servant girl on duty, and she let Peter in. The servant girl asked Peter, “Aren’t you one of this man’s disciples?” Peter replied, “No, I’m not.”

 It was cold, so the servants and guards made a fire and stood around it to keep warm. Peter joined them, trying to blend in. Inside, the high priest questioned Jesus about His disciples and His teachings. Jesus answered, “I’ve always spoken openly to everyone. I taught in synagogues and in the temple where everyone gathers. I didn’t say anything in secret. Why are you asking me? Ask the people who heard me. They know what I said.”

 One of the guards standing nearby slapped Jesus and said, “Is that how you answer the high priest?”
 Jesus replied, “If I said something wrong, tell everyone what was wrong. But if I spoke the truth, why are you hitting me?”

 Then Annas sent Jesus, still tied up, to Caiaphas, the high priest. Peter was still standing by the fire, and the people around him asked again, “Aren’t you one of His disciples?” Peter denied it again, saying, “I’m not!” A relative of the man whose ear Peter had cut off spoke up, “Didn’t I see you with Him in the garden?” Once more, Peter denied it, and just then, a rooster crowed.

 Early in the morning, they took Jesus from Caiaphas to the Roman governor’s headquarters. The religious leaders didn’t go inside because they didn’t want to make themselves unclean before the Passover festival. So Pilate, the governor, came out to them and asked, “What charges are you bringing against this man?”

 They answered, “If He wasn’t a criminal, we wouldn’t have handed Him over to you.”
 Pilate said, “Take Him yourselves and judge Him by your own laws.” But they replied, “We don’t have the authority to execute anyone.” This was to fulfill what Jesus had said about the kind of death He was going to die.

 Pilate went back inside and called for Jesus. He asked Him, “Are you the King of the Jews?”
 Jesus answered, “Is that your own question, or did others talk to you about me?”
 Pilate replied, “Am I a Jew? Your own people and the chief priests handed you over to me. What have you done?”

 Jesus said, “My kingdom isn’t from this world. If it were, my followers would be fighting to keep me from being handed over. But my kingdom is not from here.”
 Pilate asked, “So you are a king then?”
 Jesus answered, “You say that I’m a king. For this reason, I was born and came into the world: to testify to the truth. Everyone on the side of truth listens to me.”
 Pilate, with a shrug, said, “What is truth?” Then he went back outside to the crowd and said, “I don’t find anything wrong with this man.”

 But the crowd shouted back, “Not Him! Give us Barabbas instead!” Barabbas was a criminal.

 Title: The Day Everything Changed

 Beginning:
 After all the back and forth with the crowd, Pilate, the Roman governor, decided to punish Jesus even though he couldn’t find anything wrong with Him. The soldiers whipped Jesus and then made a crown out of thorns, shoving it onto His head. They dressed Him in a purple robe, mocking Him by saying, “Hail, King of the Jews!” while hitting Him.

 Pilate brought Jesus out to the crowd and said, “Look, I’m bringing Him out to you to show that I don’t find any fault in Him.” Jesus stood there, wearing the crown of thorns and the purple robe, and Pilate said, “Here is the man!” But the religious leaders and officers shouted, “Crucify Him! Crucify Him!” Pilate told them, “You take Him and crucify Him. I don’t find any fault in Him.”

 Middle:
 The crowd shouted back, “He claimed to be the Son of God, and by our law, He deserves to die!” This made Pilate even more uneasy. He went back inside and asked Jesus, “Where do you come from?” But Jesus didn’t answer.

 Pilate pressed on, saying, “Don’t you realize I have the power to either free you or crucify you?” Jesus calmly replied, “You wouldn’t have any power over me if it wasn’t given to you from above. The one who handed me over to you is guilty of a greater sin.”

 Pilate really wanted to release Jesus, but the crowd kept shouting, “If you let Him go, you’re no friend of Caesar! Anyone who claims to be a king opposes Caesar!” Feeling cornered, Pilate brought Jesus out again and sat down on the judge’s seat. He told the crowd, “Here is your King!” But they yelled, “Take Him away! Crucify Him!” Pilate asked, “Shall I crucify your King?” The chief priests answered, “We have no king but Caesar.” Finally, Pilate handed Jesus over to be crucified.

 End:
 Jesus was forced to carry His cross to a place called Golgotha, which means “the place of the skull.” There, they crucified Him, along with two others—one on each side of Him. Pilate had a sign placed above Jesus on the cross that read, “JESUS OF NAZARETH, THE KING OF THE JEWS.” Many people saw this sign because the place where Jesus was crucified was near the city. The sign was written in Hebrew, Latin, and Greek.

 The chief priests argued with Pilate, saying, “Don’t write ‘The King of the Jews,’ but that He said, ‘I am King of the Jews.’” Pilate shot back, “What I have written, I have written.”

 The soldiers who crucified Jesus took His clothes and divided them among themselves. They noticed His coat was seamless, woven in one piece from top to bottom, so they said, “Let’s not tear it. Let’s cast lots to see who will get it.” This fulfilled the scripture that said, “They divided my clothes among them and cast lots for my garment.”

 Near the cross, Jesus’ mother, His aunt, Mary (the wife of Clopas), and Mary Magdalene were standing. When Jesus saw His mother there, and the disciple He loved standing nearby, He said to His mother, “Dear woman, here is your son.” And to the disciple, “Here is your mother.” From that time on, the disciple took her into his home.

 Later, knowing that everything had now been finished and so that Scripture would be fulfilled, Jesus said, “I’m thirsty.” A jar of sour wine was there, so they soaked a sponge in it, put the sponge on a hyssop branch, and lifted it to His lips. When Jesus had tasted it, He said, “It is finished.” With that, He bowed His head and gave up His spirit.

 Because it was the day of preparation for the Passover, the Jewish leaders didn’t want the bodies left on the crosses during the Sabbath, so they asked Pilate to have the legs of the crucified men broken to speed up their deaths. The soldiers broke the legs of the two men crucified with Jesus, but when they came to Jesus, they found He was already dead, so they didn’t break His legs. Instead, one of the soldiers pierced Jesus’ side with a spear, and blood and water flowed out. This happened to fulfill the Scriptures that said, “Not one of His bones will be broken,” and “They will look on the one they have pierced.”

 Afterward, Joseph of Arimathea, a secret disciple of Jesus, asked Pilate for permission to take Jesus’ body. Pilate agreed, so Joseph came and took the body away. Nicodemus, who had earlier visited Jesus at night, brought a mixture of myrrh and aloes, about seventy-five pounds. Together, they took Jesus’ body, wrapped it in linen with the spices, as was the Jewish custom for burial. There was a garden at the place where Jesus was crucified, and in the garden was a new tomb, where no one had ever been laid. Because it was the day of preparation and the tomb was nearby, they laid Jesus there.

 Title: The Best Surprise Ever

 Beginning:
 It was super early on the first day of the week, and it was still dark outside. Mary Magdalene decided to visit the tomb where Jesus had been buried. But when she got there, she saw that the big stone that was supposed to be covering the entrance had been rolled away! Freaking out, she ran as fast as she could to tell Simon Peter and another disciple, the one Jesus loved, “They’ve taken the Lord out of the tomb, and we don’t know where they’ve put Him!”

 Middle:
 Peter and the other disciple took off running toward the tomb. The other disciple was faster and got there first. He bent down and peeked inside and saw the linen cloths that had been wrapped around Jesus’ body, but he didn’t go in. Then Peter caught up and went right into the tomb. He also saw the linen cloths lying there, and the cloth that had been on Jesus’ head was folded up separately from the rest.

 Finally, the other disciple, who had reached the tomb first, also went in, and when he saw everything, he believed. But they still didn’t fully understand from the Scriptures that Jesus had to rise from the dead. So, they went back home.

 End:
 Mary, though, stayed outside the tomb, crying her eyes out. As she wept, she bent over to look into the tomb and saw two angels in white, sitting where Jesus’ body had been—one at the head and the other at the foot. They asked her, “Why are you crying?”

 “They’ve taken my Lord away,” she said, “and I don’t know where they’ve put Him.” As she turned around, she saw Jesus standing there, but she didn’t recognize Him.

 Jesus asked her, “Why are you crying? Who are you looking for?” Thinking He was the gardener, she said, “Sir, if you’ve taken Him away, tell me where you’ve put Him, and I’ll go get Him.”

 Jesus said to her, “Mary.” Instantly, she knew it was Him and cried out, “Rabboni!” (which means Teacher). Jesus told her, “Don’t hold on to me, for I haven’t yet ascended to the Father. But go tell my brothers and say to them, ‘I am ascending to my Father and your Father, to my God and your God.’”

 Mary Magdalene hurried back to the disciples with the amazing news: “I’ve seen the Lord!” And she told them everything He had said to her.

 That same evening, the disciples were together with the doors locked because they were scared of the Jewish leaders. Suddenly, Jesus was right there with them and said, “Peace be with you.” He showed them His hands and His side, and they were overjoyed to see the Lord.

 Jesus said again, “Peace be with you! As the Father has sent me, I am sending you.” Then He breathed on them and said, “Receive the Holy Spirit. If you forgive anyone’s sins, their sins are forgiven; if you don’t forgive them, they are not forgiven.”

 One of the disciples, Thomas (also called Didymus), wasn’t there when Jesus came. When the other disciples told him, “We’ve seen the Lord!” he said, “Unless I see the nail marks in His hands and put my finger where the nails were, and put my hand into His side, I will not believe.”

 A week later, the disciples were in the house again, and this time Thomas was with them. Even though the doors were locked, Jesus suddenly stood among them and said, “Peace be with you.” Then He turned to Thomas and said, “Put your finger here; see my hands. Reach out your hand and put it into my side. Stop doubting and believe.”

 Thomas said to Him, “My Lord and my God!” Then Jesus told him, “Because you’ve seen me, you have believed; blessed are those who have not seen and yet have believed.”

 Jesus did many other miraculous signs in the presence of His disciples, but they aren’t all written down in this book. These are written so that you may believe that Jesus is the Christ, the Son of God, and that by believing you may have life in His name.

 Title: The Big Catch and an Important Conversation

 Beginning:
 After everything that had happened, Jesus appeared to his disciples again, this time by the Sea of Tiberias. It went down like this: Simon Peter, Thomas (who’s called Didymus), Nathanael from Cana in Galilee, the two sons of Zebedee, and two other disciples were all hanging out together. Simon Peter suddenly said, “I’m going fishing.” The others quickly replied, “We’ll go with you!” So they all jumped into a boat and set out, but guess what? They didn’t catch a single fish all night.

 Middle:
 Early in the morning, a man stood on the shore, but they didn’t realize it was Jesus. He called out to them, “Hey kids, caught any fish?” They answered, “Nope.” Then he told them, “Throw your net on the right side of the boat, and you’ll find some.” They did what he said, and suddenly their net was so full of fish they couldn’t even haul it in! The disciple whom Jesus loved turned to Peter and said, “It’s the Lord!”

 When Peter heard that, he quickly put on his coat (because he had taken it off), jumped into the water, and swam to shore. The other disciples followed in the boat, towing the net full of fish, since they weren’t far from land. When they got there, they saw a fire with fish cooking on it and some bread.

 End:
 Jesus said to them, “Bring some of the fish you just caught.” Simon Peter helped drag the net full of 153 big fish to shore, and despite the huge catch, the net didn’t tear. Jesus invited them, “Come and have breakfast.” None of them dared to ask who he was—they knew it was the Lord. Jesus took the bread and the fish and gave it to them. This was the third time Jesus appeared to his disciples after he had risen from the dead.

 After breakfast, Jesus turned to Simon Peter and asked, “Simon, son of Jonas, do you love me more than these?” Peter replied, “Yes, Lord, you know I love you.” Jesus said, “Feed my lambs.” He asked a second time, “Simon, son of Jonas, do you love me?” Peter answered, “Yes, Lord, you know I love you.” Jesus said, “Take care of my sheep.” Then, for the third time, Jesus asked, “Simon, son of Jonas, do you love me?” This time, Peter felt sad because Jesus kept asking him. He said, “Lord, you know everything; you know that I love you.” Jesus replied, “Feed my sheep.”

 Jesus then told Peter, “When you were younger, you dressed yourself and went where you wanted; but when you’re old, someone else will dress you and take you where you don’t want to go.” He was hinting at the way Peter would die to glorify God. Then Jesus said, “Follow me.”

 As they were walking, Peter noticed the disciple whom Jesus loved following them. Peter asked Jesus, “Lord, what about him?” Jesus replied, “If I want him to stay alive until I return, what’s that to you? You follow me!” Because of this, people started thinking that this disciple wouldn’t die, but Jesus didn’t say that. He only said, “If I want him to stay alive until I come back, what’s that to you?”

 This is the disciple who is sharing this story, and we know his story is true. Jesus did many other things too—so many that if they were all written down, the whole world couldn’t hold all the books that would be written. Amen.
